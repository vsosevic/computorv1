Polynomial equation solver (max degree 2). 42 school (UNIT Factory) educational project.

Solver parses the following input from the command line:

4 * X^2 - 4 * X^1 + 5 * X^0 = 0   - this is the mandatory part of the task

Also it can parse the equation in a much easier look:

4x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0
x^2 - 9 = 0
5x + 10 = 0
...

It's able to solve equation with negative discriminant and take a square root out of negative numbers (x^2 = -9).
